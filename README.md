# File Transfer (in Rust!)

### WIP

## Types of status code:

1xx: Informational - Request received, continuing process

2xx: Success - The action was successfully received, understood, and accepted

3xx: Redirection - Further action must be taken in order to complete the request

4xx: Client Error - The request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled

5xx: Server Error - The server failed to fulfill an apparently valid request

## Based on:
